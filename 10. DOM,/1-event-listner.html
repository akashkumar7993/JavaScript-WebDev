 Event Listner

    An event is an important part of JavaScript.A web page respond according to an event occurred. Some events are user generated and some are generated by APIâ€™s. An event listener is a procedure in JavaScript that waits for an event to occur. The simple example of an event is a user clicking the mouse or pressing a key on the keyboard.

The addEventListener() is an inbuilt function in JavaScript which takes the event to listen for, and a second argument to be called whenever the described event gets fired. Any number of event handlers can be added to a single element without overwriting existing event handlers.
