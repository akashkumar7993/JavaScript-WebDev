<h1 >What is Dom</h1>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</p>
<p>Note: It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesnâ€™t specify any relationship between objects. </p>
<p>DOM is a way to represent the webpage in a structured hierarchical way so that it will become easier for programmers and users to glide through the document. With DOM, we can easily access and manipulate tags, IDs, classes, Attributes, or Elements of HTML using commands or methods provided by the Document object. Using DOM, the JavaScript gets access to HTML as well as CSS of the web page and can also add behavior to the HTML elements. So basically Document Object Model is an API that represents and interacts with HTML or XML documents.</p>

<h3>Why DOM is required?</h3>
<p>HTML is used to structure the web pages and JavaScript is used to add behavior to our web pages. When an HTML file is loaded into the browser, the JavaScript can not understand the HTML document directly. So, a corresponding document is created(DOM). DOM is basically the representation of the same HTML document but in a different format with the use of objects. JavaScript interprets DOM easily i.e. JavaScript can not understand the tags(<h1>H</h1>) in HTML document but can understand object h1 in DOM. Now, JavaScript can access each of the objects (h1, p, etc) by using different functions.</p>
<p>Structure of DOM: DOM can be thought of as a Tree or Forest(more than one tree). The term structure model is sometimes used to describe the tree-like representation of a document.  Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects  Event listeners can be added to nodes and triggered on an occurrence of a given event. One important property of DOM structure models is structural isomorphism: if any two DOM implementations are used to create a representation of the same document, they will create the same structure model, with precisely the same objects and relationships.</p>
