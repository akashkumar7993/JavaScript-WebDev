<h1 >What is Dom</h1>
<p>The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML(Hypertext Markup Language) and XML(Extensible markup language) documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.</p>
<p>Note: It is called a Logical structure because DOM doesnâ€™t specify any relationship between objects. </p>
